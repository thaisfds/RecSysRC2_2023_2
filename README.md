# Research Challenge 2 - Movie Recommendation

Milena Moreira e Tha√≠s Ferreira

Overview The goal of this challenge is to implement a content-based movie recommender by exploiting movie metadata obtained from OMDB.1 Note that only personalized recommender implementations are acceptable. 
In contrast to RC1, which provided a restricted setup to encourage the development of very basic collaborative recommenders from scratch, RC2 provides a rich setup to foster the research and development of multi-dimensional recommenders capable of exploring both user-item interactions as well as item content information. 
As discussed in class, various implementation choices impact the quality of content-based recommendations, including choices for content representation (e.g., unigrams, n-grams, concepts, named entities, latent topics), user profiling (e.g., by aggregating positive and negative feedback), and user-item similarity estimation. 
As part of this assignment, you should try different instantiations of these components, and verify the resulting recommendation performance of your implementation by submitting your produced recommendations to Kaggle.
